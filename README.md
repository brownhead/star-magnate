============

This is a project I started a long time ago, but I can't remember exactly when. I'm fairly sure it was sometime in high school, but farther than that I'm not sure. Regardless, I rememeber it as the only time I ever got OpenGL to do anything at all for me. It's a game I started based off of another game (Star Baron 2) that I thought was a lot of fun but far too limiting.

I have no revived it in order to have a go at OpenGL once more, and this time I'll be using Rust! Using one technology that has thwarted me in the past and another one that I just don't know anything about should be fun.

It goes without saying, don't plan on anything coming out of this. But feel free to have a laugh at my expense. [/r/badcode](http://reddit.com/r/badcode) is always looking for new submissions ;).
